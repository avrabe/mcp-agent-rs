# MCP-Agent Next Steps

This document outlines the requirements that still need to be implemented, based on the `requirements.rst` file. The requirements are organized by priority and implementation difficulty.

## Protocol Implementation

1. **REQ-023: WebSocket/HTTP Transport** - ✅ Implemented WebSocket and HTTP transport layers for message exchange with connection management and error handling.
2. **REQ-024: JSON-RPC Batch Processing** - ✅ Implemented support for batch requests and responses per JSON-RPC 2.0 specification to improve throughput and reduce latency.
3. **REQ-025: Authentication and Security** - Implement authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, JWT) and transport-level encryption.

## Quality Assurance

4. **REQ-022: Formal Verification** - Apply formal verification tools (KLEE, Creusot) to critical components to ensure correctness and safety properties.

## Terminal Interface

5. **REQ-026: Dual Terminal Support** - Support both console-based and web-based terminal interfaces with simultaneous interaction.
6. **REQ-027: Terminal Configuration** - Allow configuration for console terminal only, web terminal only, or both through runtime options.
7. **REQ-028: Terminal Synchronization** - Ensure input/output synchronization between console and web terminals when both are active.
8. **REQ-029: Web Terminal Security** - Implement authentication, authorization, and encryption for the web terminal interface.
9. **REQ-030: Dynamic Terminal Switching** - Support runtime enabling/disabling of web terminal without application restart.

## Graph Visualization

10. **REQ-026: Workflow Graph Visualization** - Provide interactive visualization of workflow graphs with real-time updates.
11. **REQ-027: Agent System Visualization** - Visualize agent hierarchy, relationships, and message passing with status indicators.
12. **REQ-028: LLM Integration Visualization** - Visualize LLM integration points and data flow between components.
13. **REQ-029: Human Input Visualization** - Visualize human input points in workflows with real-time status.
14. **REQ-030: Visualization UI Controls** - Add controls for toggling visualization, zooming, panning, and selecting graph elements.
15. **REQ-031: Real-Time Visualization Updates** - Ensure visualization updates with minimal latency (<100ms).
16. **REQ-032: Web Terminal Visualization Integration** - Integrate graph visualization with web terminal interface.
17. **REQ-033: Graph Visualization API** - Provide REST and WebSocket APIs for graph data access.
18. **REQ-034: Sprotty-Compatible Visualization** - Use Eclipse Sprotty for rendering interactive graphs.

## Implementation Plan

### Next Priority: Authentication and Security (REQ-025)

Authentication and security are critical for production use of the MCP protocol. We need to implement:

- Authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, JWT)
- Transport-level encryption (TLS)
- Authorization and access control

#### Tasks:

- [ ] Design the authentication and security architecture
- [ ] Implement API key authentication for HTTP transport
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication for WebSocket transport
- [ ] Add TLS support for both HTTP and WebSocket transports
- [ ] Implement authorization and access control mechanisms
- [ ] Write tests for security features
- [ ] Document the security features and configuration options

## Completed Implementations

### JSON-RPC Batch Processing (REQ-024)

The JSON-RPC 2.0 specification includes support for batch processing, which allows multiple requests to be sent in a single message. This implementation improves throughput and reduces latency for applications that need to make multiple API calls.

#### Features Implemented:

1. **Batch Request/Response Types**

   - Added `JsonRpcBatchRequest` and `JsonRpcBatchResponse` types
   - Implemented serialization/deserialization for batch messages
   - Added utility methods for batch operations

2. **JSON-RPC Handler Support**

   - Added `handle_batch_request` method to process multiple requests concurrently
   - Enhanced `process_json_message` to detect and handle batch requests
   - Implemented proper error handling for batch operations

3. **Transport Layer Support**

   - Extended the `AsyncTransport` trait with batch operation methods
   - Updated WebSocket and HTTP transports to support batch operations
   - Added dedicated batch request endpoints

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Created benchmarks to compare individual vs. batch request throughput
   - Tested with varying batch sizes (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 requests)
   - Added mixed workload testing with different request types

#### Performance Benefits:

- **Reduced Network Overhead**: Batch requests significantly reduce TCP connection overhead
- **Improved Concurrency**: Multiple requests are processed in parallel
- **Lower Latency**: Overall response time for multiple operations is reduced
- **Better Throughput**: More requests can be processed per second
