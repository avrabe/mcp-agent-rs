# MCP Agent Web Terminal Visualization

This document shows what the workflow graph visualization would look like in the browser when the visualization example is running.

## Browser View

When you open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser, you'll see a web terminal with a graph visualization like this:

## Workflow Status Changes

As the workflow execution progresses, the visual states of the nodes change:

1. Initially all nodes are in the "idle" state (gray)
2. When a task starts, it changes to "running" state (blue)
3. When a task completes, it changes to "completed" state (green)
4. If a task fails, it changes to "failed" state (red)

## Node Status Legend

- Idle: Gray
- Waiting: Yellow
- Running: Blue
- Completed: Green
- Failed: Red

## Actual Implementation

The actual implementation uses Eclipse Sprotty for the visualization, which would render a more polished, interactive graph with:

- Smooth animations
- Hover tooltips
- Ability to click on nodes for details
- Auto-layout of nodes and edges
- Zoom and pan capabilities

## Sample Visualization (what it looks like in reality)

```
         +------------------+
         | Data Collection  |
         |  ✓ (completed)   |
         +--------+---------+
                  |
                  v
         +------------------+
         | Data Processing  |
         |  ✓ (completed)   |
         +--------+---------+
                  |
      +-----------+------------+
      |                        |
      v                        v
+------------------+   +------------------+
|     Analysis     |   |  Visualization   |
|    ✗ (failed)    |   |   ✓ (completed)  |
+------------------+   +------------------+
```

The visual design would have color-coded nodes with status indicators, animated transitions between states, and an intuitive interface for interacting with the workflow visualization.
