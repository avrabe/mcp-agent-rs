System Components
================

The MCP-Agent architecture consists of the following major components:

1. **MCP Protocol Layer**: Provides the core protocol implementation with JSON-RPC
2. **Agent System**: Implements agent patterns and lifecycle management
3. **Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates tasks and manages workflows
4. **Human Input Module**: Handles user interaction during workflow execution
5. **Telemetry System**: Provides monitoring, metrics, and alerting
6. **LLM Client**: Manages connections to various LLM providers
